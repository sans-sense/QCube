Activity Demo
==============

Activity analysis of a given git project. In the local mode, we need to upload a file with git log generated using git log --shortstat. In case of the server version, a plain http git url will do.

Unlike canned reports, this allows customization. So I can say if two committers are same and their contribs should be grouped, also allows for filtering of data. I can form arbitrary groups like teams and compare how they fare against each other.

### Reports  
1. Activity
2. Code churn

### Local Mode
